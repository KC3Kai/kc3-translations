        "28": "What's this? You're so undisciplined. You're worn out from this? *sigh* Commander, haven't you lacked motivation recently? I have no choice, then. I'll help you get your fighting spirit back. Look this way for a moment. Ready? Close your eyes. ...Ah, they opened! You opened your eyes! I'm not doing this anymore!",
        "24": "What is it, Commander? To call me out to a place like this... I'm very busy right now. Well, with fleet escorts and such. Convoys and such. Eh? What's this? For me...? W-Well...! I suppose I'll accept it. I-It's beautiful... and the size is just right...",

        "36": "0600. We're going full throttle this morning. First of all, you have to start the day with a delicious breakfast! I cooked up a huuge batch of barley rice. Now, eat up!",
        "37": "0700. Commander, what's this? You haven't gotten through much of your meal at all! No, no, this won't do at all! You have to eat properly in the morning. Here\u2014 a big helping of barley rice! ...It can't be helped. I'll give you some of my pickled radish.",
        "38": "0800. We're going to start the morning exercises. Div 5, form up! Hatakaze? Harukaze? Matsukaze? ...Oh well. We'll do the morning exercises with those who showed up. Destroyer Division 5, we're setting sail this morning!",

        "41": "1100. I get it already. I suppose it is almost lunchtime. I ate quite a lot in the morning, but I'm already getting an appetite. And you, Commander...?",
        "42": "1200. It's noon. Hm? Harukaze, what is that? ...Eh? A sandwich? What's that? Destroyers should eat barley rice! Right, Commander? ...H-Huh? You don't feel that way?",
        "43": "1300. Hmmm... Sandwiches aren't bad, but they're not something I'd eat too often. Still, thank you, Harukaze. Thanks for the meal!",
        "44": "140- Ah, Mogami-san, Mikuma-san. Hi there. Um... what's that you have? Eh? A model? Hmmm... so you build them. Eh~ how eccentric. ...Ah! No, I didn't mean it like that! If it comes out okay, would you show it to me?",
        "45": "1500. Well, I guess everyone has their hobbies. Matsukaze, what do you do on your days off? ...Eh? Ahh... I see. Fu... how eccentric. It's fine, though.",
        "46": "1600. Ah, Nowaki? What's up? Ah, I see. Nah, I haven't seen her. Right, got it. If I see her, I'll let you know.",

        "49": "1900. Commander, well~ ...I know it's wrong, but I don't really feel like working at night... ...Eh? You're ordering takeout for dinner? Ah, then I wanna order something! Umm... I'll have...",
        "50": "2000. Mmm... even Mamiya's takeout is delicious. I'm so full! Treating ourselves can be nice sometimes. Every day would be... hmm... that would be quite the luxury, huh? Yeah.",
        "51": "21... 00. ...Night is... I don't like the night. I especially dislike the sea at night. I like mornings. I like being out on the sea. I like the clear blue skies. Eh? DesRon 3? No, I'm a part of DesRon 5.",
        "52": "22... 00. The First Surface Escort Division? ...Yeah. I fought hard, but... I wanted to protect them, but... it was too intense. That's why I hate the night.",
